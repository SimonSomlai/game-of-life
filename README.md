## The Challenge

Write a simple version of the [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) with the stack ES6+JSX, React and Redux.

This challenge should take you a couple of hours and your are free to choose which feature to implement. There is no time pressure. Just notify us by email when you are done.

We are going to look at your code in terms of simplicity, structure and style. Please also write an imaginary todo list in this repository of what could be changed or added in the future.

## Actual To Do

1. ~~Create canvas grid with random generated data in store~~
2. ~~Map over state to get to next generation~~
3. ~~Refactor & add some testing~~

## Imaginary Todo ðŸŒˆ

1. Wrap around the edges for counting neighbours
2. Make it more interesting than just black and white squares
3. Allow the player to dynamically set the GRID_SIZE or SQUARES with a prompt/input tool
4. Add some extra static typing
